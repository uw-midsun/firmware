// Module for interfacing to CAN for CAN controlled relays.
//
// Requires CAN to be initialized.
//
// Allows registering a RelayRxHandler that is wrapped by a CanRxHandlerCb which is properly
// configured to unpack relay messages and handle faults. This RelayRxHandler is expected to execute
// the modifications to any GPIO pins or other mechanisms to trigger state changes to relays and
// report them back to the CANRxHanderCb which will handle the ack. These should ideally be kept
// very short, just GPIO manipulation or enqueueing events!

  RelayRxHandler handler;
  SystemCanMessage msg_id;  // Unused but helpful in debugging.

  uint8_t state_bound;  // Non-inclusive upper bound |[0, state_bound)| on |curr_state|.

// Configures |RelayRxHandler| to be triggered when |msg_id| is received. This handler should alter
// a relay or set of relays to match the expected state. In the event of a failure the status code
// should propagate back to the CanRxHandler. |state_bound| is the non-inclusive upper bound on the
// values the returned uint8_t can be. The configuration is stored in |storage|. If the relay is
// already in the expected state |handler| should still return with STATUS_CODE_OK so long as there
// are no faults.
//
// NOTE: we explicitly don't constrain |msg_id|. In theory we could force this to be a value
// defined for one of the relays in codegen-tooling. But this module could be used for any CAN
// controlled element that uses a message format of a single uint8_t. Also note that the
// |storage| is also extensible for this reason.
