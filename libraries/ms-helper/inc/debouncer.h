// The debouncer module which provides the function
//   for debouncing a GPIO input pin.
// Debouncing is simply a procedure to handle the physical "bouncing" of a switch
//   once it is pushed or released. The problem with bouncing is that it
//   creates unwanted (extra) signals which raise interrupts and prevent the main code from
//   executing.
// Requires GPIO, interrupts and soft timer to be initialized.
