// CAN TX/RX event handlers
// This is an internal module and should not be used.

// The idea is that the CAN RX ISR pushes received message into a queue and raises an RX event.
// In the FSM, when we encounter an RX event, we pop the messages in the RX queue
// and decide what to do based on the event type:
// * Data: Find registered RX handler and run the corresponding callback. If an ACK was requested,
//         we send an ACK as a response. The callback may choose to set the ACK's status.
// * ACK: Find the corresponding pending ACK request and process the ACK.

// For TX, its primary purpose is rate-limiting. The idea is that we raise TX events to process
// requested transmits in the main loop instead of chaining them off of the TX ready interrupt.
// This prevents transmits from starving the main loop.

// We expect TX and RX events to be 1-to-1 and that discarded events will be re-raised externally.
