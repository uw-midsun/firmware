// Note 2: The PWM output module uses all channels on a given timer,
//         this means that you cannot use PWM input with PWM output
//         on the same channel.
// Note 3: Not all timers support PWM output. TIM2 is reserved for
//         soft timers. Other timers may be flat out incompatible.
//         Please check the STM32 reference manual for compatability
//         information.

// Known issue: if the PWM DC reading transitions from a non zero number to zero,
// then the next |pwm_input_get_reading| will return the previous value instead of
// 0. The one after that will return the correct value DC and period value of 0.
// This is because a flag needs to be cleared first (internally, the stm32
// register does not update for a PWM reading of 0)
//
// Therefore we need to do this check twice to see if it works. The end user
// should not need to worry about this too much assuming they are calling the
// read function relatively frequently
